Redep
Redep is an on-click deployment platform consisting of three main parts: upload service, deploy service, and [insert third part here].

Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone the Redep repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/pranav514/redep.git
2. Install Dependencies
Navigate into each folder (upload-service, deploy-service, Request Handler) and install dependencies using npm:

bash
Copy code
cd upload-service
npm install
bash
Copy code
cd deploy-service
npm install
bash
Copy code

npm install
3. Set Up Cloudflare Account and R2 Bucket
Ensure you have a Cloudflare account. Create an R2 bucket for storing your deployment files. Initially, there will be no charges. Copy the access ID, endpoint, and required credentials.

4. Configure Environment Variables
In each folder (upload-service, deploy-service, third part), create a .env file and set the following environment variables:

plaintext
Copy code
ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_access_key_id
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_secret_access_key
ENDPOINT=your_endpoint
Replace your_access_key_id, your_secret_access_key, and your_endpoint with your Cloudflare R2 bucket credentials.

5. Run the Project Locally
Start each service locally by running:

bash
Copy code
npm start
6. Access the Application
Access the upload service, deploy service, and [insert third part] at the following URLs:

Upload Service: http://localhost:port (replace port with the port number specified in the upload service configuration)
Deploy Service: http://localhost:port (replace port with the port number specified in the deploy service configuration)
